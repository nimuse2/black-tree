## Developer Notes

A simple app to get all flags from open data API:
```https://github.com/lennertVanSever/graphcountries```

To then search through them with a text filter and display correct flag!

Notes:
- Structure: Would improve by abstracting code more into components
- Routing: React Router
- External API: Used quite simple, reliable Coutry Flags
- CSS: Bootstrap
- Test: Very, very Simple test in App.test.js
